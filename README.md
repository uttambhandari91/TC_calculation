# TC_calculation
AM alloys dataset is in TC_dataset.
Thermal conductivity of various additive manufacturing alloys are calculated using machine learning model
At first, machine learning models with default parameters are trained with the datset. The optimal model machine learning model is selected based on the statistical metrices. The optimal model is futher tuned up using GRID search method.
The final model is also tested with the ICONEL 718 AM alloys. The dataset of ICONEL 718 alloy is provided in dataset file new_steel.csv
