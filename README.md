# TC_calculation
AM alloys thermal conductivity (TC) dataset is created by measuring the TC of various alloys using Netzsch LFA 467 HT HyperFlashÂ®- light flash apparatus.
At first, machine learning models with default parameters are trained with the datset. The code is  The optimal model machine learning model is selected based on the statistical metrices. The optimal model is futher tuned up using GRID search method.
The final model is also tested with the ICONEL 718 AM alloys. The dataset of ICONEL 718 alloy is provided in dataset file new_steel.csv
